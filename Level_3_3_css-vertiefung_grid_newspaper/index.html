    <h2>Burning, shattering and cutting drama in our kitchen</h2>

            <h3>Shattering cookware</h3>
            <p> More than 37,000 people were injured from using cookware. Hot handles
                can burn and sometimes glass cookware can shatter.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="item2">
            <h3>Microwave oven burns</h3>
            <p> More than 10,000 people were hurt using microwaves. Burns were most
                common.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="item3">
            <h3>Knife cuts</h3>
            <p>Lacerations caused by knives of all kinds (not just the kitchen type) affected
                more than 350,000 people in 2012, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Dull knives are
                actually more dangerous than sharp ones, because they require more pressure to use and their worn edge
                can cause the knife to slip off food and into your fingers.</p>

        <article class="item4">
            <h3>Cooking fires</h3>
            <p>Fires involving cooking equipment account for two of every five reported
                home fires. Unattended cooking equipment accounts for one in three fires, and half are ignited by fat,
                grease, oil, or related substances, according to the National Fire Protection Association.</p>

            <h3>Contact Burns</h3>
            <p>From Equipment The oven is magic. No longer do we have to sear our food on
                an open fire like our ancestors did; we have a nifty box that keeps the heat contained and cooks our
                food to perfection. But all that heat combined with metal components and cookware leads to loads of
                burns. Quick tips (which are obvious, but good to keep in mind): Always use oven mitts, replace them
                when they’re old; don’t use a wet towel as an oven mitt; don’t reach your arm in to check baked goods,
                pull out the rack to test;

            <h3>Death to the Pathogens</h3>
            </p>The most insidious of all dangers, perhaps, are the germs lurking
            in your food. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that each year roughly one
            in six Americans (or 48 million people) gets sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne
            diseases. The top five culprits sending Americans to the hospital are salmonella, norovirus,
            Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii and E.coli – but much can be done in terms of proper food
            handling, cooking and storage to help prevent these pathogens from causing illness.</p>
